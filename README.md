-- What is The Problem , How Assign Agent To Conversation Fairly. 


-- Solution is , Apply Round Ribbon Algorithm To Solve This Problem.

-- What is Round Ribbon Algorithm ?
   Round Robin is the preemptive process scheduling algorithm. Each process is provided a fix time to execute, it is called a quantum. Once a process is executed for a given time period, it is preempted and other process executes for a given time period. Context switching is used to save states of preempted processes.


-- What is The Problem When Apply Round Ribbon Algorithm and How To Solve This ?

-- Round Ribbon Algoritm for Apply This Algorithm need Shared Global List and This List is Updated,this is problem --> Time Performance Because When Add,Update,Delete,Insert 

   You need Update This List.

-- Solve This Problem Using  Apply Round Ribbon Algorithm Using One Column (Mark)  By Get  One Agent Not Mark  and Assign This Agent to Conversation and Mark This Agent , if All Agents are Marked, Update All Agents Expect First Agent to Not Mark and Get First Agent and Assign This Agent To Conversation.


-- What is Benefits To Solve This Algoritm ? Improve And Organized Thinking And Think Different Approach To Solve Any Problem And Focus Aslo Performance Not Only Solve Problem.
