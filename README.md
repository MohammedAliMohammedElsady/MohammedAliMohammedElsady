## Round Ribbon Algorithm
 Round Robin is the preemptive process scheduling algorithm. Each process is provided a fix time to execute, it is called a quantum. Once a process is executed for a given time period, it is preempted and other process executes for a given time period. Context switching is used to save states of preempted processes.


## Cons
Round Ribbon Algoritm for Apply This Algorithm need Shared Global List and This List is Updated,this is problem --> Time Performance Because When Add,Update,Delete.You need Update This List.

## Complexity of Round Ribbon  Algorithm
O(n) and Time Of Each Operation When Add, Update , Delete. Updated This  Shared Global List,Complexity This One Operation is O(n)

## Complexity of My Own Implementation
O(n)


## How To Solve This Problem  

Solve This Problem Using  Apply Round Ribbon Algorithm Using One Column (Mark)  By Get  One Agent Not Mark  and Assign This Agent to Conversation and Mark This Agent , if All Agents are Marked, Update All Agents Expect First Agent to Not Mark and Get First Agent and Assign This Agent To Conversation.

## What I Have Learned 

Improve And Organized Thinking And Think Different Approach To Solve Any Problem And Focus Aslo Performance Not Only Solve Problem,Even if this problem is not solved by someone this is my solution and this solution is innovative by yourself.
